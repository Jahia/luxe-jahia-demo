# Luxe Prepackaged Site

Need context or build instructions? [Head to the Luxe README](../..).

This package contains the contents of the demo website:

- 10 pages
- 5 blog articles
- 2 landing pages (pages that are not referenced in the site itself, and that can be used for advertising campaigns)
- 4 agencies
- 200 real estate properties
- 6 realtors
- About 400 images

> [!NOTE]
> The site contains a lot more than "10 pages" because each blog article, agency, property, etc. will have its own page. 10 pages is the number of pages contributed by hand through the page creation interface.
