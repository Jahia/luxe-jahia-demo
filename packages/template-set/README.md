# Luxe Template Set

Need context or build instructions? [Head to the Luxe README](../..).

**The goal of this document is to explain the implementation choices** made during the development of the Luxe template set.

Business requirements can sometimes be implemented in many different manners (this is true for all programming projects), and the choices made during the integration phase impact performances, editors experience, maintainability and many other aspects. **The choices made during the development of Luxe reflect the current best practices for Jahia.** Each time another approach could have been chosen, we’ll let you know and then it’s up to you, depending on the project you have to develop, to choose a path or another.

This document is still being worked on as we refine our best practices. Stay tuned for updates!
