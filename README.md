# Luxe

Luxe is the demo website for Jahia 8.2, built using the [JavaScript Modules](https://academy.jahia.com/tutorials-get-started/frontend-developer/introduction) technology. Through a fictional real estate agency, it showcases the capabilities of Jahia and the JavaScript Modules technology.

This repository is a [monorepo](https://monorepo.tools/#understanding-monorepos) that contains different packages, each with its own purpose:

- [`template-set`](./packages/template-set/): the Jahia module that, when pushed on a Jahia instance, allows creating all Luxe components and content types.

The repository is under active development, the upcoming packages will be added soon:

- [`design-system`](./packages/design-system/): a collection of reusable React components used by the template-set.
- [`prepackaged-site`](./packages/prepackaged-site/): a prepackaged site that can be used to quickly get a populated Luxe site.
